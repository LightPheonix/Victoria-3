        <p id="text">As of October the 30th 2022 I have around 10 hours or more in this game and the game was released 
            one week ago. First of all I want to explain why I love this game. Victoria 3 is really game which 
            makes you feel that you are in that world, ruling your country into the age of Industrialization 
            and prosperity which it bring along with it. That aspect of the game is my favorite, it's soo easy to 
            roleplay in Victoria 3.

        <p id="text">In the picture above you can see an ingame screenshot of the game map. The player is
            playing as the Country of Sweden and is zoomin into the City of Jönköping. In this game, the cities 
            you rule over can grow or become ghost towns depending on the decisions you make! So be carefull if
            you are going to use childeren in you mines, it can have consequenses!

        <img id="img2" src="victoria-3-battle.png" alt="Picture of how battle's look like in th game">
        <p id="text">The picture above is from the game, this is how the war mechanics in the game looks like.
        I personaly like this mechanic which is newly implemented by the producers, but this war mechanics
        has become a very contreversial thing in the Victoria 3 community. But in my opinion, it's a very good idea!
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope that you will also like the game as much as I do! Now, go and lead you Nation to Prosperity!
